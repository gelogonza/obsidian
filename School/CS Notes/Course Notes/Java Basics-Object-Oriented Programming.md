### Java Classes/Methods

- Every java program is made up of classes

```Java
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args)
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
      }
   }
   
   //this is a method with the class HelloWorld that prints out
   // Hello World!
```

- public- access modifier that allows this class ti be accessed anywhere
- static- means it belongs to the class
- void- no return value
- String[] args - arguments for the command-line

  

### Variables and Types

- Java is a statically typed language
    - This means that you have to declare the type
        
        - Types consist of
            - int
            - double
            - boolean
            - char
        
          
        
        ```Java
        int x = 420;
        double y = 13.2;
        boolean isAngeloGoated = true;
        char grade = 'F';
        ```
        

### Methods

- all of the logic that you will write in Java is written in methods.
    - Other languages refer to them as functions
