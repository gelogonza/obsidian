## **Translating Propositional Logic Statements 🗣️**

### **Translating English Sentences into Propositional Logic**

1. **Identify atomic propositions** in the sentence.
    - Determine what would be propositions.
2. **Represent propositions with variables.**
    - Represent propositions in a positive manner and negate if necessary.
3. **Identify logical connectives.**
    - Connectives include negations, disjunctions (or), conjunctions, and implications.
4. **Translate using variables and connectives.**
5. **Verify and identify what each proposition represents.**

**Example:**

"If I go to the store or the movies, I won't do my homework."

- PP = I go to the store
- QQ = I go to the movies
- RR = I do my homework

The statement can be translated as: P∨Q  ⟹  ¬RP∨Q⟹¬R

## **Practice Problems ✍️**

### **Practice Problem 1**

**Statement:** You can get a free sandwich on Thursday if you buy a sandwich or a cup of soup.

**Rewritten in if-then form:** If you buy a sandwich or a cup of soup, then you can get a free sandwich on Thursday.

- PP = I buy a sandwich
- QQ = I buy a cup of soup
- RR = I get a free sandwich on Thursday

**Solution:** (P∨Q)  ⟹  R(P∨Q)⟹R

### **Practice Problem 2**

**Statement:** You can get a free sandwich on Thursday only if you buy a sandwich or a cup of soup.

_Using the same propositions as above:_

- PP = I buy a sandwich
- QQ = I buy a cup of soup
- RR = I get a free sandwich on Thursday

**Solution:** R  ⟹  (P∨Q)R⟹(P∨Q)

### **Practice Problem 3**

**Statement:** The automated reply can't be sent when the system is full.

**Rewritten in if-then form:** If the system is full, then the automated reply can't be sent.

- PP = The system is full
- QQ = The automated reply can be sent

**Solution:** P  ⟹  ¬QP⟹¬Q

## **Translating Propositional Statements into English 🌐**

1. **Substitute variables with their corresponding English phrases.**
2. **Replace logical connectives with English words.**
3. **Write the statement in a way that makes sense.**

**Example:**

- QQ = You can ride the rollercoaster
- RR = You are under 4 feet tall
- SS = You are older than 16 years old

**Propositional Statement:** R∨¬S  ⟹  ¬QR∨¬S⟹¬Q

**Step 1:** If RR or not SS, then not QQ

**Step 2:** If you are under 4 feet tall or not older than 16 years old, then you cannot ride the rollercoaster.

**Alternative:** If you are under 4 feet tall or younger than 16 years old, then you cannot ride the rollercoaster.
