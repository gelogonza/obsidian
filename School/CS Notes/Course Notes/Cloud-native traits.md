### Security

- crucial because cloud computing involves
    - storing
    - processing
    - transmitting data
- cloud-based applications can be accessed from anywhere in the world, which makes them pron to cyber attacks

### Resiliency

- ability of an application to react to problems in one its components and still provide the best possible service

### Least-privilege

- priniciple that a security architecture should be designed so that each entity is granted the minimum system resources and authorizations that the entity needs to perform its function

### Redundancy

- Duplication of critical system components in order to increase a system’s reliability

### Network security

- involves protecting an orgs computer networks and network-connected devices from unauth access, cyber attacks, and data breaches

### Application Security

- involves protecting an organization’s application from cyber attacks and data breaches

### Data Security

- involves protecting an orgs data from unauth access, theft, and corruption

### How is research valuable to a Cloud Computing Engineer?

- Keeping up with emerging technologies
    - by researching, your are staying up to date with new technologies and trends
- Improving cloud architecture and design
    - can help with better strategies for optimizing cloud performance, cost reduction, and improving scalability and availability
- enhancing cloud security
    - research best practices for securing cloud infrastructure, data, and applications
    - also emerging security tech such as zero-trust architecture
- evaluating cloud service providers
    - research can help with choosing which one to go with and why.
        - better solutions
        - reliability
        - performance
        - security
        - and cost effectiveness
- advancing the field of cloud computing
    - all this research will ultimately make you better within your sector.
    - this means that you are working indirectly towards advancing the field of cloud computing

### How to conduct good research:

- Find relevant information
- cross-check facts
    - dont pull from a single source
- compile all information found and cite
