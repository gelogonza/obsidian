Proof by contraditction:

Claim: the product of an irrational and a rational number is irrational. (always true/ universal)

Proof: let r be a rational and x an irrational number

Goal: show rx is irrational

Suppose toward a contradiction that rx is rational (negation of the conclusion/goal). Since r is rational there exists qp which are elements of integers for which q≠0, r=p/q. Since we assumed rx is rational there exists ab elements if integers for

  

- Prime numbers
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: Every normal number >1 can be written as a product of powers of primes
- Why are primes so important?
- Rsa algorithm
- RSA key generation process
- Public/private key encryption relies on generation large new prime numbers
    - Claim: the number of prime numbers is infinite
    - Lemma: for any 2 numbers n and m that are natural if n is at least 2 then n times nm+ 1 is not a multiple of n.
    - Proof: let n, m element of N with n> 2. A multiple of n. Then nm ≠
    - Cycle is a trail with at least 1 edge where the first and last vertices are the same
    - Tree is a graph without cycles that is connected
        - Claim: a grpah is a tree iff every pair of vertices has exactly one path between them
