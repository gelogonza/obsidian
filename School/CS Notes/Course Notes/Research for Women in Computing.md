## Grace Hopper

Grace Hopper was a woman in the field of computer science during the 1940s-50s. She was in a very male-dominated field at the time. One of the challenges she faced was skepticism/questioning of her abilities because she was a woman in computing. People didn’t think her idea of using words similar to english for programming syntax would work. Her colleagues didn’t think that would succeed. However, she overcame these obstacles by creating the first compiler, the “A-0” system. She changed coding forever. She overcame the obstacles by never giving up and being incredibly driven.

Her contributions to technology/computer science were her invention of the compiler, she also worked on the Harvard Mark 1 which was used during WW2. She also led the development of FLOW-MATIC which was the first programming language that used her English syntax. Another huge thing she worked on was the development of COBOL and it was a high-level programming language at the time. It’s still used today as well, which shows just how big her contribution was. She also coined the term “debugging”. It’s important we highlight her because she has changed programming by making it more accessible and essentially laid the groundwork for software development, her story also promotes diversity, she broke gender barriers in computing, and her work has changed the lives of others.

  

## Chieko Asakawa

Chieko Askawa is a blind woman in tech. She lost her eyesight at the age of 14. She is also the first female Japanese IBM Fellow, which broke gender barriers and ability-based barriers. She faced many challenges because there are very few blind professionals in the space. Her colleagues would also doubt her effectiveness on web development, people would also struggle to imagine the solutions she would propose for problems in the blind tech space. She overcame the obstacles by earning a degree whilst being blind, enrolling in a two-year course for the blind specifically for programming, joining IBM and also getting a Ph.D. While at IBM she brought solutions to things related to the blind. Since she had a unique perspective she could work on solutions that would increase the accessibility for the blind.

She invented the first voice web browser for the blind. She was also a developer for Braille tecnnologies, creating tools like editors and dictionaries. Recently she has been leveraging AI to assist in real-world navigation for the blind. It’s important we highlight her because she is not only a woman in computing, she is also blind. She has developed solutions for some problems that would greatly increase the lives of the blind. It shoes that diversity drives innovation. Her accomplishments show that even with disabilities, you too can accomplish great things. Her career has been about improving the lives of others.
