key points from Bhavna Davé's article, _"Keeping Labour Mobility Informal: The Lack of Legality of Central Asian Migrants in Kazakhstan"_:

1. **Informal Labor Migration**: Kazakhstan’s migration regime is characterized by the informality of labor mobility. Most Central Asian migrants, especially from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, work informally in sectors such as construction, household work, and services. Despite the visa-free regime under the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), there is no legal framework for semi-skilled or low-skilled migrants, rendering the majority of them "illegal" in the eyes of the state​(DaveLabourMigKaz).
2. **State's Strategic Neglect**: Kazakhstan deliberately neglects the scale of informal labor migration, which keeps migrants legally invisible and disposable. This strategy benefits the state and local authorities by enabling rent-seeking and corruption while avoiding the need to reform labor laws that would otherwise legitimize these workers​(DaveLabourMigKaz).
3. **Circular Migration and Deportability**: Migrants often engage in circular migration—shuttling between Kazakhstan and their home countries to renew their temporary visitor status. The constant threat of deportation creates a condition of "deportability," making migrant labor easily disposable and maintaining a power dynamic that benefits employers and corrupt officials​(DaveLabourMigKaz).
4. **Lack of Legal Employment Framework**: The legal framework only provides quotas for highly skilled foreign workers, with no formal provisions for the employment of low-skilled migrants. Despite recent attempts to introduce labor patents (licenses) similar to those in Russia, these reforms have been ineffective at addressing the embedded informal migration regime​(DaveLabourMigKaz).
5. **Corruption and Exploitation**: Migrants are forced to navigate a corrupt system, where intermediaries, border officials, and police demand bribes to overlook legal violations such as overstaying visas or working without permits. This creates a symbiosis between legal and illegal practices that allows the informal economy to thrive while keeping migrants vulnerable​(DaveLabourMigKaz).
6. **Semi-Compliance and Bypassing the Law**: Migrants often maintain a veneer of legality by registering as visitors but working informally, a strategy of "semi-compliance." This allows them to bypass stringent legal requirements while avoiding outright illegality. They rely on networks and informal systems to remain undetected or manage encounters with authorities​(DaveLabourMigKaz).
