would be sort of difficult to find a place for asylum seekers and refugees due to our migration policies. We want workers that have specific skils and can help improve our economy. Our focus will be in potential permanent migrants that are willing to assimilate into our culture rather than catering towards asylum seekers and refugees. Since we have a unique and hard language we will have catsuvian and russian as the main languages. We are going to establish a cultural engagement initiative by offering culture and language lessons to migrants that are looking to become part of our country, however we are not going to mandate them and rather just have it as an open opportunity.

  

  

- what is the incentive for the skiled professionals program?
    - what will cause them to want to move there specifically bc of this program
        - pay, housing, ?
- if trying to promote high skilled workers to migrate to ur country, should you maybe lower the requirements needed?
