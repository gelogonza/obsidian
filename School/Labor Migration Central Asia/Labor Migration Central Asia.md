Focus on the drivers of migration. Schmidt & Sagynbekova article: what major factors drove migration to Kyrgyzstan in the Russian Imperial years and the Soviet period? How do those differ from factors driving migration out of Kyrgyzstan in the 1990s and 2000s? (And yes, this article is from 2007--many things have changed since then.) Does anything from lecture help to explain these differences?

What do you learn about Kyrgyzstan's people and culture from this article? How do you think those factors might shape migration for labor, if at all?

### Factors Driving Migration to Kyrgyzstan:

1. **Russian Imperial Period:**
    - **Colonization Efforts:** Russian expansion into Central Asia in the 19th century led to significant migration, particularly the movement of Russian peasants to Kyrgyzstan. This was part of a broader strategy to strengthen Russian presence in the peripheries of the empire.
    - **Stolypin's Reforms:** The Resettlement Act of 1904, which encouraged Russian peasants to move to Central Asia by offering incentives like tax exemptions, also played a major role.
    
2. **Soviet Period:**
    - **Forced Migrations:** Under Soviet rule, there were several waves of forced migrations, including the deportation of various ethnic groups like Germans, Chechens, and Crimean Tatars to Kyrgyzstan during Stalin's purges.
    - **Industrialization and Employment:** The Soviet government also facilitated migration to Kyrgyzstan by relocating workers and entire factories from the European parts of the USSR to Central Asia, especially during World War II and the post-war period.

### Factors Driving Migration out of Kyrgyzstan in the 1990s and 2000s:

1. **Post-Soviet Economic Decline:**
    - **Economic Hardship:** After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan faced significant economic difficulties, leading to high unemployment and declining living standards. This economic decline became a major push factor for emigration.
    - **Brain Drain:** The emigration included many highly qualified professionals, contributing to a shortage of skilled labor in Kyrgyzstan and further exacerbating economic challenges.
2. **Political and Ethnic Tensions:**
    - **Ethnic Repatriation:** Many ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and other groups left Kyrgyzstan to return to their countries of origin or to Russia, driven by both economic factors and a sense of insecurity as Kyrgyzstan transitioned into an independent state with rising nationalistic sentiments.

### Differences in Migration Drivers:

- **Russian Imperial and Soviet Eras:** Migration was primarily driven by state policies aimed at colonization, forced resettlements, and economic centralization efforts. The movement was largely directed by the state to achieve specific political, military, and economic objectives.
- **Post-Soviet Era:** Migration was more voluntary and economically driven, with individuals seeking better living conditions abroad due to the economic collapse and political instability in Kyrgyzstan.

### Cultural Insights and Impact on Labor Migration:

The article suggests that the Kyrgyz people have a long history of mobility, from the nomadic traditions of the Kyrgyz population to the forced and voluntary migrations under Russian and Soviet rule. This history of mobility likely contributed to a cultural resilience and adaptability that shaped their participation in labor migration. The reliance on extended family networks, social cohesion within communities, and the role of remittances are significant cultural factors that continue to influence migration patterns today.

These cultural factors might encourage labor migration as a viable strategy for economic survival, with strong social networks facilitating the movement of people and the transfer of remittances back home. However, the article also highlights the social costs, including the strain on family structures and the psychological impact on migrants, which could influence future migration trends.

In summary, the drivers of migration to and from Kyrgyzstan have shifted from state-driven policies in the Russian and Soviet periods to economically motivated individual decisions in the post-Soviet era. Cultural factors, such as the tradition of mobility and strong family networks, continue to shape migration patterns in Kyrgyzstan.

  

Some reasons why migration was prevalent

- Russian peasants moved after 1890 due to the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. From what it looks like it seems like it was part of a strat to strengthen the russian strat. the stolypin resettlement act of 1904 also encouraged migration due to tax exemptions and other subsidies for farming and materials.
- it was also part of military strategy to strengthen russian control around its central asian territories. however this also did lead to issues between russian and the indigenous people of kyrgzystan

  

  

- Kyrgyzstan population is about 7 million people
- Capital: Bishkek
