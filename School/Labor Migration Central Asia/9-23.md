The introductory chapters of **“Paradoxes of Migration in Tajikistan: Locating the Good Life”** delve into the complex interplay between economic necessity, social obligations, and personal aspirations that drive migration from Tajikistan to Russia. The narrative begins with the author’s encounter with **Marhabo**, an English teacher in her early 30s from a mixed Tatar–Uzbek family in the Sughd Province. While walking through her small town, which displays both dilapidated Soviet-era infrastructure and newly built homes funded by remittances, Marhabo laments, “There’s nothing here!” This expression of “nothingness” reflects not just the lack of economic opportunities but also the overwhelming social pressures to uphold cultural rituals and familial duties.

The text explores how **migration has become an intrinsic part of achieving moral personhood** in Tajik society. To be considered a “good person,” individuals feel compelled to fulfill life projects such as organizing lavish ritual celebrations (tūi), building homes, and caring for elderly parents. These expectations place significant financial burdens on families, often making migration the only viable means to meet them. However, this creates a paradox: while migration provides the resources needed to uphold social norms and achieve the “good life,” it also leads to family separations and challenges to traditional values.

The author introduces the concept of **“locating the good life”** to analyze how people navigate these contradictions. This involves not only seeking economic stability but also repositioning their ideas and practices within new social and geographic contexts. Migration to Russia offers a sense of autonomy and escape from communal scrutiny, yet it also exposes individuals to precarious legal statuses and potential marginalization in Russian society.

Historical context is provided to underscore that current migration trends are rooted in both Soviet-era policies and the aftermath of the Tajik Civil War (1992–1997). The collapse of the Soviet Union and the war led to economic decline, infrastructural decay, and a surge in unemployment, which, in turn, intensified labor migration. Over the past three decades, remittances from migrants have become crucial for Tajikistan’s economy, deeply influencing social dynamics, gender roles, and notions of respectability.

The text also touches upon the complexities of the Russian migration regime, which categorizes Tajik migrants primarily as temporary laborers subject to strict regulations. Navigating legal requirements for residency and work permits in Russia is challenging, often leaving migrants in vulnerable positions.

In summary, the introductory chapters set the stage for a detailed examination of how Tajik individuals and families grapple with the paradoxes of migration. They are caught between the necessity to migrate for economic survival and social fulfillment, and the desire to maintain their cultural identity and moral standing within their communities. The pursuit of the “good life” is thus a continuous process of negotiation and adaptation in the face of shifting social, economic, and political landscapes.
