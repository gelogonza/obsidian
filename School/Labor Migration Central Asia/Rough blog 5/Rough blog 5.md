Migration from Central America to the United States remains one of the most enduring and complex migration crises in modern history. In Blog Post 4, we explored the systemic forces driving migration, the treacherous migrant journey through Mexico, and how theories like _push-pull factors_ and _structural violence_ help explain these dynamics. Building on those ideas, this post delves deeper into migration from the Northern Triangle—Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala—by examining the lived experiences of migrants, connecting these realities to key migration theories, and evaluating how policies shape migrant outcomes.

The stories depicted in _Sin Nombre_ mirror the struggles of real Central American migrants whose decisions to leave their homes are rooted in violence, poverty, and a lack of opportunity. Understanding these migration patterns requires us to view them through both human and theoretical lenses. This post highlights the structural forces shaping migration, the challenges migrants face, and the broader implications of transnational migration.

**Systemic Forces Driving Migration from the Northern Triangle**

The Northern Triangle has become synonymous with forced migration due to a combination of systemic issues, including widespread violence, economic deprivation, and environmental challenges.

**Push Factors: Violence and Poverty**

Gang violence, fueled by organized groups like _MS-13_ and _Barrio 18_, remains one of the most significant drivers of migration. Gangs dominate entire neighborhoods, extorting families, forcibly recruiting youth, and targeting women with gender-based violence. According to the **UNHCR**, in 2020, over 500,000 individuals from Central America were displaced by gang violence and insecurity.

Economic instability compounds these challenges. Nearly 60% of the population in Honduras lives below the poverty line (World Bank, 2022), with rural regions suffering the most. _The Age of Migration_ (de Haas et al., 2020, p. 28) explains this through **push-pull factors**: lack of jobs and security pushes individuals to migrate, while wage differentials in the United States serve as a pull factor.

**Historical Context: A Legacy of Instability**

The historical role of U.S. intervention in Central America cannot be ignored. Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. supported authoritarian regimes to suppress leftist movements, exacerbating political instability and inequality (de Haas et al., 2020, p. 19). These interventions left behind weak institutions and systemic corruption, which continue to drive migration today.

**The Migrant Journey: Personal Stories and Harsh Realities**

The journey to the United States is one of extraordinary danger. As highlighted in Blog Post 4 and _Sin Nombre_, migrants must traverse Mexico aboard _La Bestia_—freight trains controlled by cartels and smugglers. This journey exposes migrants to extortion, kidnapping, and physical harm.

• **Women and Children**: Gendered vulnerabilities are especially stark. Women face sexual violence, trafficking, and exploitation along the route. Unaccompanied minors are at risk of recruitment by cartels or being abandoned by smugglers. According to **Amnesty International** (2018), two-thirds of women migrants report experiencing gender-based violence during their journey.

**A Personal Story**

For instance, María, a 17-year-old from Honduras, fled after gang members threatened her family for refusing to pay rent (extortion fee). Her journey through Mexico was marked by violence and hunger, but her hope for a safe future kept her going. Stories like María’s reflect how structural violence, as described by Johan Galtung and cited in _The Age of Migration_ (p. 59), limits choices and forces individuals into life-threatening decisions.

**Migration Theories and the Northern Triangle**

Understanding migration dynamics from the Northern Triangle requires a connection to key theories:

1. **Push-Pull Factors** (Lee’s Theory):

• Push factors: violence, poverty, environmental degradation.

• Pull factors: economic opportunities, family reunification, and existing social networks in the U.S.

2. **Structural Violence**:

• Migrants face systemic barriers that prevent access to basic resources (education, jobs, safety), leaving them vulnerable to violence and exploitation. De Haas argues that migration cannot be fully understood without recognizing these structural forces (p. 59).

3. **Cumulative Causation**:

• Migration becomes self-perpetuating over time. Families rely on remittances from relatives abroad, which create expectations for future migration (de Haas et al., 2020, p. 64). Social networks lower the risks and costs of migration, encouraging others to follow the same path.

4. **Transnationalism**:

• Migrants maintain ties to their home countries while building new lives abroad. Remittances sent back to Central America sustain communities, illustrating the transnational nature of migration (de Haas et al., 2020, p. 62).

**Policies and Migrant Realities**

While migration is driven by systemic forces, policies in the United States and Mexico shape migrant experiences:

• **U.S. Policies**: Policies like Title 42 and the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) have restricted asylum access, forcing migrants to wait in dangerous Mexican border cities. These policies reflect the **securitization of migration**, where states treat migration as a security threat rather than a humanitarian issue (de Haas et al., 2020, p. 91).

• **Mexico as a Transit and Destination Country**: Under pressure from the U.S., Mexico has intensified immigration enforcement, detaining and deporting Central American migrants. However, this approach fails to address the root causes of migration, instead exacerbating vulnerabilities.
