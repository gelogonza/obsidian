**Root Causes of Migration in the Northern Triangle**

Migration from Central America's Northern Triangle, which consists of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, is driven by deeply rooted systemic problems that offer individuals no feasible options. As mentioned in Blog Post 4, migration isn't merely a matter of preference but rather a question of survival. Economic struggles, widespread violence, and historical disparities combine to create the "push factors" that drive individuals to abandon their residences, whereas social connections and job prospects serve as "pull factors," motivating migration to the north. This section examines the fundamental reasons for migration by utilizing push-pull theory, structural violence, and dependency theory.

  

**Economic Hardship and Inequality**

A major factor driving migration from the Northern Triangle is prevalent poverty and inequality. According to World Bank reports, more than 60% of Hondurans are living under the poverty threshold, with rural regions facing the greatest levels of unemployment and food scarcity. In Guatemala, comparable poverty levels disproportionately impact Indigenous and rural communities, with agricultural failures exacerbating economic instability. De Haas’s push-pull theory illustrates that factors like poverty, unemployment, and restricted access to resources drive individuals away from their home countries, whereas higher wages and job prospects in the United States act as compelling pull factors (de Haas et al., 2020, p. 28). Nonetheless, these economic migration models frequently neglect structural obstacles like inadequate education, political corruption, and imbalanced economic systems which significantly restrict individuals' options in areas such as the Northern Triangle. For instance, remittances make up to **20%** of GDP in Honduras and El Salvador, demonstrating an economic reliance on migration instead of sustainable development (CFR Report, 2022). This showcases worldwide economic disparities outlined in The Age of Migration (de Haas, 2020, p. 6), in which countries in the Global South depend on low-value agricultural exports, whereas affluent nations control high-value sectors. This trend reflects to our readings about labor migration patterns in Central Asia, where individuals from nations such as Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan move to Russia because of economic stagnation at home and the attraction of better wages overseas. Both instances demonstrate how reliance on remittances sustains migration and exacerbates global disparities.

  

**Gang Violence and Forced Migration**

The Northern Triangle ranks among the world's most violent areas, as Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala are afflicted by criminal groups such as MS-13 and Barrio 18. Gangs intimidate families, coerce young men into joining, and assault women with sexual violence, causing whole communities to exist in fear and lawlessness.

De Haas's theory on forced migration posits that people do not migrate only for economic factors, but also due to systemic violence, persecution, and insecurity (2020, p. 59). This notion corresponds with the UNHCR's discovery that nearly 500,000 individuals are displaced each year in Central America as a result of violence linked to gangs.

Women and children are especially at risk. Gender-based violence is employed as a means of control, leading to physical and psychological damage for women. Young males are pressured to join gangs, facing threats of death to themselves or their loved ones.

As emphasized in Blog Post 4 and clearly depicted in _Sin Nombre_, migration turns into a means of survival instead of a choice made voluntarily. The individual narratives of migrants expose the profound fear and trauma inflicted by these systemic forces, highlighting the harsh truth of structural violence.

In comparison, Central Asia encountered comparable forced migrations after the Soviet collapse, as ethnic and political conflict uprooted communities, compelling individuals to escape to neighboring countries such as Russia. In both scenarios, poor governance and insecurity worsen the crisis, making populations susceptible to exploitation.

  

The historical legacy of U.S. intervention in Central America throughout the 20th century is inseparable from the root causes of migration. During the Cold War, the United States backed authoritarian governments in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to counter leftist movements, undermining stability and worsening inequality.

According to de Haas in The Age of Migration, the historical dynamics between the Global North and South have significantly influenced migration patterns (2020, p. 8). These connections are fundamental to dependency theory, which posits that the political and economic frameworks of underdeveloped countries are influenced—and frequently exploited—by richer countries.

In the Northern Triangle, military dictatorships supported by the U.S. stifled democratic reforms, resulting in rampant corruption and fragile institutions that continue to exist today.

This historical instability established the foundation for today's violence and economic inequality, resulting in an environment where migration emerges as a systemic result rather than a personal decision.

  

**The Perilous Journey through Mexico**

The journey through Mexico is among the riskiest phases for Central American migrants escaping violence and destitution. Migrants frequently turn to traveling on freight trains called La Bestia (“The Beast”), facing dangers such as physical harm, dehydration, and threats from criminal groups. Cartels dominate a large portion of the route, requiring fees for transit, abducting those who can’t afford to pay, and exposing women to elevated levels of sexual violence. As reported by Amnesty International, 66% of women migrants indicate that they have faced assault during their travels, highlighting the increased dangers they encounter.

Mexican law enforcement practices, shaped by U.S. border externalization tactics, intensify these risks. Faced with demands to decrease migration, Mexico’s National Guard apprehends migrants, compelling them into crowded shelters or detention facilities with minimal access to essential services (WOLA, 2021). Hein de Haas emphasizes this as a component of gatekeeping policies in which affluent nations transfer border enforcement duties to transit countries (2020, p. 91). These actions emphasize border regulation, disregarding the humanitarian requirements of migrants and making them susceptible to increased exploitation and violence.

Regardless of the dangers, migration continues because of the strengthening influence of social networks and remittances. Cumulative causation, outlined by de Haas, demonstrates how every wave of migration establishes support networks that reduce expenses for subsequent migrants (de Haas, 2020, p. 64). Families combine their resources to finance trips, and those who arrive in the U.S. send money back that supports whole communities. This cycle illustrates how migration is profoundly integrated into the lives and aspirations of those escaping the Northern Triangle, even in the face of life-threatening challenges.

  

**The Role of U.S and Mexican Immigration Policies**

The immigration policies in the United States and Mexico significantly influence the experiences of migrants from Central America. Instead of tackling the underlying causes of migration—like systemic violence and economic disparity, these policies emphasize deterrence and border security, frequently exacerbating the perils migrants encounter. This emphasis represents what de Haas calls migration governance, in which policies aim to regulate migration instead of eradicating it, thereby sustaining inequalities and vulnerabilities (de Haas, 2020, p. 14)

In the United States, policies such as Title 42 and the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) illustrate the securitization of migration, prioritizing border enforcement over humanitarian concerns. Title 42, enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, permits the swift removal of migrants at the border without considering their asylum requests. Likewise, MPP compels asylum seekers to remain in perilous Mexican border towns while their cases are processed. Towns like Matamoros and Tijuana frequently suffer from violence, putting migrants at risk of extortion and mistreatment. According to the CFR Report, these policies unfairly affect migrants from the Northern Triangle, pushing them into unstable living situations and denying them their right to pursue safety.

Mexico, facing pressure from the U.S., has progressively assumed the role of a gatekeeping nation. The use of the National Guard to stop and apprehend migrants underscores the outsourcing of U.S. border security. According to de Haas, these types of policies enable richer countries to shift the responsibility of migration management onto transit nations, thus decreasing their own accountability (de Haas, lets move 2020, p. 91). However, Mexico does not have the infrastructure to manage the surge of migrants. Shelters are congested, and migrants in detention frequently encounter mistreatment, insufficient medical attention, and a lack of food, according to WOLA (2021).

These policies do not tackle the underlying systemic reasons for migration and instead heighten the dangers that migrants encounter. Rather than alleviating the crisis, enforcement actions worsen vulnerabilities and lead to additional humanitarian issues. Tackling migration from the Northern Triangle necessitates moving from deterrence approaches to inclusive policies that focus on development, security, and governance in Central America.

**Family and Resilience**

For numerous migrants from Central America, family is a crucial factor in their choice to migrate. Driven by the wish to reconnect with family or offer financial aid via remittances, the aspiration for a brighter future compels migrants to face significant dangers. Migration frequently occurs as a family-oriented process, influenced by economic responsibilities and cross-border ties. Hein de Haas’s idea of transnationalism suggests that migrants keep robust emotional and economic connections to their countries of origin (2020, p. 62)

Remittances serve as an essential financial support system for communities in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. In certain Northern Triangle countries, remittances make up as much as 20% of GDP (CFR Report, 2022). These resources assist families in obtaining essential necessities such as food, education, and healthcare, alleviating local poverty while simultaneously strengthening economic reliance. As highlighted in the WOLA Report, this financial assistance emphasizes the strength of migrants, who persist in managing these duties despite facing systemic obstacles and exploitation during their travels.

Also, the emotional impact of migration is considerable, especially for families divided by borders. Children who are abandoned encounter developmental difficulties, while those accompanying their parents experience trauma and instability. These separations within families reflect larger challenges observed in different areas, like Central Asia, where economic migration to Russia similarly disrupts family units while supporting their livelihoods. In spite of these challenges, the ongoing flow of migration emphasizes the remarkable resolve of Central American migrants, motivated by their affection for family and aspirations for an improved future.

  

**Comparisons to Centra Eurasian Migration**

The migration trends observed in the Northern Triangle display notable similarities with labor migration in Central Asia, especially from countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to Russia. In both instances, systemic economic disparities and historical dependencies propel extensive migration patterns, mirroring the overarching structural factors influencing global migration.

Economic difficulties are key factors in migration in both areas. Central Asian countries, similar to the Northern Triangle, experience significant unemployment, underdeveloped economies, and dependence on remittances. For example, in Tajikistan, remittances make up more than 30% of GDP, akin to the Northern Triangle countries where they represent as much as 20% of GDP (CFR Report). This reliance on the economy illustrates dependency theory, in which underdeveloped countries are connected to richer economies that take advantage of their labor and resources (de Haas, 2020, p. 8)

Individuals from both areas also face considerable exploitation and institutional challenges. Central Asian migrants in Russia encounter discrimination, harsh working conditions, and restricted access to legal safeguards—situations that reflect the difficulties experienced by Central American migrants journeying through Mexico. In both instances, affluent countries delegate border enforcement, establishing gatekeeping regulations that transfer accountability to transit nations. For Central Americans, Mexico implements U.S. border control measures, whereas in Central Asia, Russia enforces stringent visa regulations and deportation policies that disproportionately impact migrants.

Regardless of these obstacles, the determination of migrants from both areas is still evident. Social networks, cumulative causation, and cross-border connections support migration, establishing routes for others to replicate. Analyzing these two areas reveals that migration is not a standalone occurrence; rather, it mirrors global systemic disparities and common human desires for survival and prospects.

  

**Addressing the Roots and Realities of Migration**

Migration from the Northern Triangle of Central America is not merely an option, but often a necessity driven by chronic economic struggles, violence, and historical exploitation. As emphasized in this examination, migration theories like push-pull factors, structural violence, cumulative causation, and dependency theory aid us in comprehending how systemic forces, rather than personal choices, propel these movements. The journey across Mexico, characterized by severe dangers and exploitation, highlights the pressing necessity for policies that emphasize humanitarian protection rather than deterrence.

The influence of U.S. and Mexican immigration policies highlights the worldwide trend of gatekeeping, in which affluent countries delegate enforcement to transit nations, heightening the risks faced by migrants. Comparisons with labor migration in Central Asia illustrate how comparable systems of inequality and dependence fuel migration worldwide, linking human experiences across different areas.

Tackling the Central American migration crisis necessitates a focus on sustainable solutions fostering governance, economic opportunities, and security while rethinking policies to prioritize human dignity and safety. Acknowledging migration as both a profoundly individual and worldwide concern is the initial move toward promoting empathy, comprehension, and enduring transformation.
