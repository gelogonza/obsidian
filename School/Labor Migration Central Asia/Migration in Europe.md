why the Soviet Union tried to attract Uighurs to leave China and come to Soviet Central Asia after WWII:

- post ww2 european countries with literal shortage of manpower due to deaths during war
- other european refugees such as germans from what is now present day poland
- decolonization, immigrants from former imperial lands
- germany is creatingeconomic growth from workers buying their resources and by also helping improve the economy by working for cheaper
- essentially germany doesnâ€™t lose in any situation from all this
- germany wins by having turkey pay for mostly everything
- 1973-1989 dual labor markets
    - recession, high unemployment in 1973; some migrants returned home
    - acive recruitment of foreign workers and colonial workers largely ceased
    - new system
    - migrant labor is horrible , difficult, dangerous, or just simple jobs that the regualr citizens dont want to do; agricultural and domestic labor
- soviet union equals mnore money so they also tried to attract people because of that too
- 1990s neo-liberalism says global trade is good and that barriers should be removed to trade
- schengen agreeement was a treaty that created the schengen area; a zone of 27 european countries where border control had been abolished. which allowed for unrestricted movement between all those member states without needing a passport or a visa.
    - this was signed in 1985 by belgium, france, germany, luxembourg, and the netherlands
