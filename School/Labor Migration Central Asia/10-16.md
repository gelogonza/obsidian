### ==1.== ==**Transformation of Matrimonial Arrangements in Tajikistan**==

- ==The paper focuses on the impact of migration and poverty on marriage practices in Tajikistan, particularly the rise of polygyny.==
- ==**Polygyny**== ==is examined as a means of negotiation within patriarchal structures, offering men and women agency in their marriage decisions.==

### ==2.== ==**Influence of Migration and Poverty**==

- ==Tajikistan has high levels of labor migration, particularly to Russia, leading to long separations between spouses.==
- ==Migration often results in:==
    - ==**Increased divorce rates**====, leaving many women unmarried or in vulnerable situations.==
    - ==**Demographic imbalances**====, where there are fewer marriageable men in Tajikistan due to labor migration.==
    - ==Economic hardships make polygyny an attractive option for women seeking financial security.==

### ==3.== ==**Polygyny and Patriarchy**==

- ==**Polygyny**== ==is illegal under Tajik law, but remains widespread, often socially and religiously tolerated.==
- ==It is viewed as a response to migration-induced social challenges, such as men having extramarital relationships while abroad.==
- ==**Nikoh**== ==(religious marriage) is often used to formalize second or third marriages, especially when men remarry without formal state recognition.==

### ==4.== ==**Gendered Experiences and Marriage Dynamics**==

- ==**Men’s dissatisfaction**== ==with arranged marriages and the desire for greater autonomy in choosing partners.==
- ==**Women’s motivations**== ==for entering polygynous unions often stem from economic necessity or dissatisfaction with their first marriages.==

### ==5.== ==**Legal and Social Dimensions of Polygyny**==

- ==There are calls to legalize polygyny to protect the rights of second wives and their children, though these arguments are controversial.==
- ==Advocates argue that polygyny addresses social issues like unmarried women, but these views are based on traditional and patriarchal assumptions.==

### ==6.== ==**Religion and Tradition**==

- ==While== ==**Sharia**== ==allows polygyny, many Tajik men justify it as part of== ==**traditional culture**== ==rather than a strictly religious practice.==
- ==The rise of polygyny is sometimes framed as a return to cultural traditions rather than a religious resurgence.==

### ==7.== ==**Fieldwork Insights**==

- ==The study is based on 11 months of ethnographic fieldwork in northern Tajikistan, combining interviews and observations.==
- ==Men and women use polygyny to navigate the constraints of== ==**traditional patriarchal rules**====, sometimes challenging or subverting these norms.==

### ==8.== ==**Broader Context of Polygyny in Central Asia**==

- ==The paper contributes to studies on labor migration in Central Asia by focusing on men’s experiences with polygyny, a topic less discussed in migration literature.==

### =="Migration, Education, and the Gender Gap in Labour Force Participation" by Abdulloev, Gang, and Yun:==

1. ==**Objective and Focus**====:==
    - ==The paper examines the impact of migration and education on the gender gap in labor force participation (LFP) in Tajikistan.==
    - ==The gender gap in LFP is significant, with men participating much more than women.==
    - ==Migration, primarily male-dominated, reduces domestic male LFP, while increased female education boosts women's participation in the workforce.==
2. ==**Key Findings**====:==
    - ==**Migration**====: 93.5% of migrants from Tajikistan are men. As men migrate abroad, their participation in the domestic labor market declines, which narrows the gender gap but reduces overall employment.==
    - ==**Education**====: Women with higher education, particularly university or vocational training, are more likely to enter the labor market. Education plays a crucial role in reducing the gender gap in LFP.==
3. ==**Tajikistan’s Economic and Social Context**====:==
    - ==Tajikistan, heavily dependent on remittances from male migrants, has significant wage gaps between men and women.==
    - ==Women face segregation into lower-paying sectors like agriculture, education, and healthcare.==
    - ==Female labor force participation is low (31.1% for women vs. 58.1% for men in 2007).==
4. ==**Role of Education**====:==
    - ==The paper emphasizes the need for expanding women's access to vocational and higher education, particularly in rural areas, to increase their participation in the labor market.==
    - ==**Urban vs Rural**====: Rural women face greater barriers to obtaining education due to fewer professional schools in rural areas.==
5. ==**Gender Gap and Migration**====:==
    - ==Migration has a== ==**demonstration effect**====: Male relatives often anticipate migrating, leading to a decline in their domestic labor participation.==
    - ==Female relatives of migrants, in contrast, may increase their participation to compensate for the absence of male breadwinners.==
    - ==The== ==**gender gap in migration experience**== ==widens the gender gap in LFP. If more women had access to migration opportunities, the gender gap in LFP would shrink further.==
6. ==**Policy Implications**====:==
    - ==Increasing access to professional education for women, particularly in rural areas, could help reduce the gender gap in LFP.==
    - ==Migration policies and labor market reforms should account for the gendered effects of migration and education on workforce participation.==
7. ==**Conclusion**====:==
    - ==Both migration and education significantly influence the gender gap in LFP in Tajikistan.==
    - ==Encouraging female education and addressing the gender disparities in migration could lead to more balanced labor force participation rates.==

  

# ==reading 3 syrian refugee women==

### ==1.== ==**Objective of the Study**==

- ==The paper focuses on the== ==**profile of Syrian refugee women**== ==in Turkey and their== ==**expectations**== ==for social inclusion in the host country.==
- ==A mixed-methods approach is used, combining a questionnaire administered to 47 Syrian refugee women in the Cappadocia region and a literature review.==

### ==2.== ==**Key Findings**==

- ==**Demographic Information**====:==
    - ==Most participants (87%) are== ==**housewives**====, aged 21–40, with more than five children.==
    - ==**Educational background**== ==is low, with the majority having only primary education, and a significant number being illiterate.==
    - ==Most women have been in Turkey for 3-4 years and have== ==**low proficiency in the Turkish language**====, with 85% at the basic A1 level.==
- ==**Expectations**====:==
    - ==**Return to Syria**====: The majority (78%) hope to return to Syria once the war ends.==

        - ==Few women want to work themselves; only two participants expressed a desire for employment.==
    - ==**Integration Challenges**====: Many feel== ==**excluded**== ==due to their nationality and cultural differences, making it hard to establish a new life in Turkey.==

### ==4.== ==**Refugees' Feelings of Insecurity**====:==

- ==Syrian refugee women frequently mention feeling== ==**insecure**== ==in their new environments, especially in refugee camps, due to harassment and gender-based violence.==

### ==5.== ==**Conclusions and Policy Implications**====:==

- ==**Educational and Vocational Programs**====:==
    - ==The study suggests implementing education programs to improve== ==**language proficiency**== ==and provide== ==**basic vocational training**== ==to help women integrate and become more independent.==
    - ==Expanding access to employment opportunities could improve their social and economic status.==
- ==**Long-term Integration**====: Some refugee women expressed a desire to stay in Turkey permanently, indicating that more attention should be given to their== ==**social inclusion**== ==and== ==**cultural integration**====.==
