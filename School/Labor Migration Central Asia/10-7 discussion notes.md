# The Age of Migration: Policies and Labor Market Impacts

- **Labor Market Segmentation**:
    - Migrants and minorities tend to be overrepresented in low-skilled, low-wage sectors, such as agriculture, construction, and domestic services. Despite possessing higher qualifications, migrants frequently find themselves in jobs that offer limited opportunities for upward mobility. This is often due to systemic barriers, such as non-recognition of foreign qualifications, language proficiency issues, or legal constraints.
    - **Segmentation** refers to the division of labor markets into separate sections, where certain jobs are earmarked for native workers and others, typically lower-status jobs, are left for migrants and minorities.
- **Ethnic Discrimination**:
    - Discrimination against migrants based on ethnicity is a significant factor that exacerbates their economic marginalization. Employers may undervalue foreign qualifications or prioritize native workers, making it difficult for migrants to secure employment that matches their skill level.
    - The authors also discuss how negative stereotypes and biases contribute to the persistence of these inequalities, resulting in wage disparities and fewer career advancement opportunities for migrants and minorities.
- **Legal Status and Vulnerability**:
    - Migrants with precarious or undocumented legal status are particularly vulnerable in the labor market. These individuals are often forced into the informal sector, where they are exposed to exploitation, such as low wages, poor working conditions, and the absence of social security or labor protections. Legal status plays a critical role in determining access to labor rights and protections.
    - Even when migrants have regular legal status, they may face restrictions related to visa conditions that limit their job options.
- **Gendered Experiences**:
    - The chapter highlights how gender intersects with migration, influencing the types of jobs that male and female migrants tend to occupy. Women migrants are often concentrated in sectors such as domestic work, caregiving, and hospitality, which are undervalued and offer little protection.
    - Female migrants, particularly those from developing countries, may face a double burden of discrimination based on both their gender and migrant status, leading to greater vulnerability to exploitation and abuse in the labor market.
- **Policy and Social Integration**:
    - De Haas and co-authors explore how different countries adopt various policies to integrate migrants into their labor markets. Some countries focus on assimilation, aiming to integrate migrants into the existing workforce, while others emphasize multiculturalism, which recognizes and accommodates cultural differences.
    - However, policies aimed at labor market integration are often insufficient in addressing the deeper structural issues that cause inequality. The authors argue that without targeted measures to reduce discrimination and address the vulnerabilities associated with precarious legal status, many migrants will continue to face barriers to full economic integration.
- **Economic Contribution vs. Marginalization**:
    - The chapter acknowledges that migrants make significant economic contributions to both their home and host countries through remittances and by filling labor shortages in critical industries. However, despite their contributions, they remain marginalized in many labor markets due to systemic barriers and policies that perpetuate inequality.
    - The authors stress the need for reforms that can better integrate migrants into the labor force and offer them the same opportunities and protections as native workers.

## Migrants in the Labor Market

### The Contribution of Migrant Workers to Economic Expansion

- Some economists argue that migrant labor made a crucial contribution to the post-WWII economic boom by replacing local workers and enabling them to obtain more productive, higher-skilled jobs. (p. 279)
- However, others argue that immigration can reduce efficiency by keeping low-productivity firms viable and holding back the shift to more capital-intensive production. (p. 279-280)
- There is a close correlation between economic growth and immigration levels, but the dominant direction of causality is that fast-growing economies attract more migrants due to high labor demand and skills shortages. (p. 280)

### Economic Impacts of Low-Skilled Immigration: Winners and Losers

- The socioeconomic benefits (and potential costs) of low-skilled immigration are not evenly distributed across destination country populations. (p. 280)
- Immigration primarily benefits businesses and higher-income groups, while non-migrant low-skilled workers may feel more threatened and trade unions may feel it undermines their power. (p. 280)
- Higher-income groups benefit more than low-income earners, as they can access cheaper personal services and see increased productivity and profits in their businesses. (p. 280-281)
- The effects on wages of lower-skilled native workers are complex, as migrants often do work that locals are no longer prepared to undertake, but negative effects are most likely if new migrants compete directly with the existing workforce. (p. 280-281)

### Migrant Employment Patterns: The First Generation

- By 2017, foreign-born workers made up a substantial share of the labor force in many OECD countries, ranging from around 30% in Switzerland and Australia to 11% in the Netherlands and France. (p. 281, Figure 12.1)
- Migrants are increasingly bringing skills with them, and can be found across the economy, although they remain overrepresented in lower-skilled jobs. (p. 281-282)
- In 2017, about 65% of employed migrants in the OECD area worked in low- or medium-skilled jobs, compared to around 55% for native-born workers. (p. 282, Figure 12.1)
- Migrants are overrepresented in specific service occupations requiring high-skill levels, such as teachers, doctors, nurses, and computer experts. (p. 282)
- Despite the increasing importance of skilled migration, overall migrants still tend to have lower occupational status and higher unemployment rates than non-migrant workers. (p. 282)
- There is huge variation in unemployment levels among migrants in OECD countries, with some countries having much higher unemployment gaps between foreign- and native-born workers. (p. 283, Figure 12.2)

## Key Takeaways

- Migration policies encompass a range of tools related to integration, exit, and diaspora engagement. (Section: Migration Policy Tools)
- The "need" for low-skilled migrant labor is socially constructed and reflects the interests of employers and dominant social classes. (Section: The Social Construction of Labor Needs)
- Demographic changes and the inability to offshore certain sectors have contributed to the sustained demand for migrant workers in industrialized countries. (Section: Changing Structure of Labor Demand)
- The economic impacts of low-skilled immigration are unequally distributed, with higher-income groups and businesses benefiting more than low-skilled native workers. (Section: Economic Impacts of Low-Skilled Immigration: Winners and Losers)
- Migrant employment patterns show increasing diversity, with migrants present across the skills spectrum, but still overrepresented in lower-skilled jobs and facing higher unemployment rates. (Section: Migrant Employment Patterns: The First Generation)

## Gender-Segregated Labor Markets and the Disadvantages Faced by Migrant Women

- Migrant women face a "triple discrimination" due to their status as migrants, gender-specific prejudices, and stereotypes based on ethnicity and race (Section 1)
- Migrant women are susceptible to abuse, discrimination, and precarious employment, especially if they have undocumented status or informal jobs (Section 1)
- Employers often view migrant women as temporary workers who will leave to get married, rather than primary breadwinners (Section 1)
- Migrant women are disadvantaged in sectors like the garment industry and domestic work, which are characterized by gendered and racialized labor (Section 1)

## The Chronic Demand for Migrant Labor

- Labor market segmentation means that people's job prospects depend on factors like gender, race, ethnicity, and legal status, not just "human capital" (Section 2)
- Dual labor market theory explains the "chronic" demand for low-skilled migrant labor in advanced economies (Section 2)
- Immigrants have played a crucial role in the transformation of urban economies, often filling low-wage jobs in sectors like retail, personal services, and maintenance (Section 2)
- The Great Recession had a disproportionate impact on migrant employment, but foreign employment still increased in many OECD countries (Section 2)

## The Second Generation: Progress and Continued Discrimination

- The second generation (native-born with foreign-born parents) generally has better educational outcomes than the migrant generation (Section 3)
- However, the second generation still lags behind their native-born peers without a migration background (Section 3)
- Factors like parental socioeconomic status and the original mode of labor market incorporation can have intergenerational effects (Section 3)
- Ethnic discrimination in hiring remains widespread, with minority candidates needing to send significantly more applications to get interviews (Section 3)

## Migrant Entrepreneurship

- Migrants tend to have more adventurous and entrepreneurial mindsets than those they leave behind (Section 4)
- Migrant entrepreneurship has become more common since the 1980s, particularly for groups facing labor market discrimination (Section 4)
- Migrant entrepreneurs can often rely on cheap or free labor from family members, though this may decrease with later generations (Section 4)
- Migrant entrepreneurship rates vary across OECD countries, with over-representation in some regions and under-representation in others (Section 4)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Country|Migrant Entrepreneurship Rate (2007-2008)|
|Australia, UK, France, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, US, Central and Eastern Europe|Over-represented|
|Southern Europe, Ireland, Israel, Germany, Austria, Switzerland|Under-represented|

# PARADOXES OF MIGRATON

Pages 91-94 and 101-107 of _Paradoxes of Migration in Tajikistan_ by Elina Borisova delve into the complexities of migration and the sociocultural and moral dynamics surrounding Tajik migrants.

### Pages 91-94

These pages explore how migration intertwines with the local understanding of modernity in Tajikistan. Borisova examines how the perception of modernity is tied to socialist history and the way it has evolved in the face of increasing global mobility. Migration to Russia, in particular, is framed as an aspiration for Tajik migrants to craft a sense of being “modern,” influenced by their experience of Soviet modernity and the desire to align themselves with Russian forms of modernity. Yet, this quest is fraught with tension because the migrants are denied full integration into Russian society. They are often seen through the lens of their utility as laborers, racialized, and excluded from the benefits of Russian modernity. This creates an ambivalence—migrants are vital to Russia’s economy, yet they remain marginal in terms of social recognition.

Borisova highlights the paradox wherein migrants’ labor contributes to building Russian modernity, but their presence in Russia simultaneously strips them of claims to it. This racialized exclusion is reinforced by the Tajik state, which imposes a rigid form of modernity and tradition within its borders, further complicating migrants' identities and experiences.

### Pages 101-107

The next section of the book transitions into the concept of masculinity and care. Borisova discusses how the Tajik men who migrate are framed by their responsibilities and duties back home. These men often endure significant hardship while abroad, but their return is marked by expectations of providing care, both financially and socially. The experience of migration thus reshapes the migrant’s sense of self, especially as they navigate the gendered expectations of their role as caretakers of their families.

The discussion of masculinity touches on the emotional endurance that Tajik men must exhibit while dealing with the difficult conditions of migrant labor. The author ties this into broader concepts of morality and ethics, showing how migrants try to maintain their sense of self-worth in the face of dehumanizing conditions. Despite the hardships they face in Russia, many migrants view their work as a duty to their families, with care being seen as a performance of their gendered role as providers.

Thus, this section provides a deeper look at the internal struggles Tajik migrants face, not only in their treatment abroad but also in how their identities as men and caretakers are constructed and deconstructed through the migration experience.

This analysis shows how Borisova intricately weaves together the local and transnational dynamics of modernity, identity, and care in Tajikistan, focusing on the ambivalence of migrant experiences.
