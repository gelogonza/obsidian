We are aiming to encourage labor migration to address our workforce shortages caused by our aging population. We are trying to do this while discouraging permanent migration in order to preserve our culture. Using temporary workers could help stabilize our economy. Doing this will hopefully ensure growth without affecting our culture. To discourage permanent migration we will make the application process for residency/citizenship really strenuous. Another thing weâ€™re going to implement is a preferential tax structure that will benefit low-income migrants over permanent residents. Ultimately, these policies will allow us to increase economic stability from a temporary workforce without negatively impacting our culture.
