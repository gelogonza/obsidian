### 1. Labor Migration Policy:

We aim to **encourage labor migration** to address the aging population and ensure a sustainable workforce. Elderia’s economy is diversified, and to maintain its growth, skilled and semi-skilled laborers are necessary. Priority will be given to sectors that need immediate support, like healthcare, technology, and infrastructure.

### 2. Permanent Migration Policy:

We will **cautiously attract permanent migrants**, particularly those with skills in areas essential to the economy. However, there will be cultural integration programs to ensure that migrants contribute to and respect Elderia’s unique language and traditions. The policy will favor individuals who can support our long-term demographic and economic stability.

### 3. Temporary Migration of Citizens:

We will **encourage temporary migration** for educational and work purposes. This will help Elderian citizens gain valuable experience and skills abroad, which they can bring back to enhance the country's diversified economy. The government will provide incentives for citizens to return and reinvest their knowledge and earnings in Elderia.

### 4. Permanent Migration of Citizens:

We will **discourage permanent migration** of Elderian citizens. With a shrinking youth population, retaining younger generations is crucial. Policies such as financial incentives, job opportunities, and housing benefits will be implemented to reduce the brain drain and keep talent within the country.

### 5. Refugees and Asylum Seekers:

Elderia will adopt a **selective acceptance** of refugees and asylum seekers. While we recognize the humanitarian responsibility, the focus will be on those who can integrate into Elderian society and contribute to the economy. Support programs will be provided for their integration, especially in learning the language and adapting to cultural norms.

### 6. Visa, Border Enforcement, and Taxation Policies:

- **Visa Policy**: We will offer a points-based visa system, giving priority to skilled workers, investors, and entrepreneurs. Cultural and linguistic integration will be a requirement for long-term visas and permanent residency.
- **Border Enforcement**: Borders will be carefully managed to prevent illegal immigration, but with a focus on facilitating the entry of skilled migrants and tourists.
- **Money Transfer/Taxation Policy**: We will facilitate **low-cost remittances** for temporary migrants to send money back home, encouraging their return. Taxes for expatriates will be structured to incentivize repatriation of wealth and skills.
