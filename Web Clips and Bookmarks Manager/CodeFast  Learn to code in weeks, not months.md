## Wait... is it possible to learn that fast?

The average JavaScript course on Udemy is 64 hours. To build a tiny business, you would also need:

- + 72 hours for React
- + 32 hours for MongoDB
- + 16 hours for Tailwind, etc...

But the truth is, you'll only use 20% of what you learn.

[![](https://codefa.st/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fudemy.ff9b2a66.png&w=3840&q=100)](https://codefa.st/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fudemy.ff9b2a66.png&w=3840&q=100)

Pareto principle for online courses

These courses prepare you for the competitive job market.

But as an entrepreneur?

You need just enough to build your idea!

In 2025, AI makes coding even easier. It explains code, fixes bugs, and writes sections of your app for you.

[https://codefa.st/ai.mp4](https://codefa.st/ai.mp4)

üåü AI gives you superpowers when you know the fundamentals

You don't need to know how CSS box-shadow works to create a button... Just ask the AI to do it for you!

CodeFast teaches you how to code like an entrepreneur:

- Learn the essentials (no fluff)
- Use AI to build faster
- Launch your idea

    Students learning to code
    
- I was fired from school and university.
- The way teachers taught was boring and impractical, so I didn‚Äôt care.
- In 2016, I faced the same issue trying to learn coding. Courses were too long and made for people who want to get a job. I almost gave up... üòî
- So I skipped the theory, built tiny apps, and made my first $1,000 online with a few lines of code.

- I realized I didn‚Äôt need to know everything to create something useful.
- Over time, I built [25 tiny businesses](https://marclou.com/) and earned over $200,000 with my SaaS. Now, coding is even easier‚ÄîAI writes and fixes code for you.
- So I built CodeFast, the course I wish I had when I started:
- - Short lessons
    - Skip the fluff
    - Build real businesses

    Students learning to code
    
- This course took 9 months and was shaped by 50 students in a beta. Some even made money with their 1st app! I hope you like it too.
